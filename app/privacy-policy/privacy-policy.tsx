                  According to the UN, over 733 million people globally faced
                  hunger in 2023â€”equivalent to one in every eleven people, and
                  in Africa, it's a staggering one in five. Most of the world's
                  hungry live in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Even more
                  alarming, hunger is rising in other regions like Western Asia
                  and the Caribbean, highlighting an ever-growing problem
                  affecting millions. But hunger is not just about missing
                  meals; it is a deeply entrenched issue that stifles
                  opportunities and keeps communities trapped in cycles of
                  poverty.

                  <i>
                    Additionally, according to a New York Post publication in
                    2019,
                  </i>{" "}
                  74% or 245 Million Americans buy gifts for others so they can
                  use them, with the current market estimated to be a staggering
                  $162 billion and expected to reach $388 billion by 2027, It's
                  interesting to note while gift-giving is a thriving industry,
                  the contrast is stark when considering the pressing issue of
                  hunger. Hence the Age of Hunger liberation was long overdue!

                <p className="mb-3">
                  This movement draws inspiration from the lived experiences of
                  Titus Gicharu, founder and CEO of Brandlogs. Having endured
                  hunger as a child during one of Kenya's worst droughts,
                  Titus's journey has fueled his passion for global hunger
                  relief, sparking the Birthday Hero Challenge as his way of
                  giving back.

                  Consider who you choose to share with, because people who can

                  businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example,
                  when you share a post a date, or an event with specific
                  people, brands, or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or
                  reshare that content to others across or off our Products.
                  Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to
                  their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone
                  who can see the other person's content, and that person can
                  change the audience later. People can also use our Products to
                  create and share content about you with the audience they
                  choose. For example, a brand interested in your content can
                  mention or tag you at a location or event in a post, or share
                  information about you in their posts or messages. If you are
